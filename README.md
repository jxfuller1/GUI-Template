# GUI-Template
GUI Template using PyQt5 that can be used for any program that you want to make.  Decided to create this so that i wouldn't have to create a GUI
from scratch whenever I wanted to make a new program and has option settings for the user.

1) You can easily add multiple programs to this GUI
2) Sections of the GUI are broken up into different files
3) Has settings options that you can modify
4) See instructions in UI_Template for adding programs to the GUI
